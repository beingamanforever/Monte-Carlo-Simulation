# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
Usage of Monte Carlo Simulation to Optimise Portfolio to maximise an investor's max returns off a given investment amount vested among various assets.

# About the project 
I forecasted stock prices using the Monte Carlo simulation. I used this data to predict the weights associated with each associated for getting maximal returns at minimal risk. Moreover I generated the optimum portfolio using various risk-return measures like sharpe ratio, and discussed various normality quantification norms like Q-Q plot etc. I also analysed the relationship between various assets by correlation and covariance matrix that would help the investor in finding the optimal portfolio based on a certain risk-free rate.
